This repository contains datasets for counting trees on phylogenetic terraces

\subsubsection*{Recreating the counts}

{\itshape output.\+csv} can be created with the following command (while in the data directory) \begin{DoxyVerb}for tree in *.nwk*; do data=${f%.nwk*}.data${f#*.nwk}; echo "\"${tree}\",\"${data}\",$(path/to/app $tree $data)"; done > output.csv\end{DoxyVerb}
