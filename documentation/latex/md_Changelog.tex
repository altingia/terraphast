\subsection*{Optimizations }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item implement bitvector with rank support
\item use bitvector instead of index vectors for subsets
\item inline lots of often-\/used methods
\item deduplicate constraints
\item remap constraints (removing inner nodes from the numbering)
\item halved union-\/find storage by out-\/of-\/bounds parent trick
\item avoid allocations by reusing old storage
\item some micro-\/optimizations
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Fixes and Features }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item fast terrace check without traversing the tree to the end
\item fixed subtree computation (problematic input data caused an assertion to fail)
\item fix counting bug (communication problem)
\item don\textquotesingle{}t count incorrectly rooted trees
\item extracted all computations to callback methods
\item implemented logging + stack state decorators
\item implemented isomorphy check
\item Visual C++ compatibility checked with appveyor
\item extracted intrinsics to stay portable
